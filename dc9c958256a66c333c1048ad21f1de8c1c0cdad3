(it\u0027s not clear what the status of that code is).\n\nChrome doesn\u0027t support viewing webarchives, though, and nobody seems to have been upset by this lack. So I guess removing it from browser as well is not that big a deal. Trying to keep it would make it very difficult to handle file:// URLs safely.",
