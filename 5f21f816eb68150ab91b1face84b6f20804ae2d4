      "message": "I really like your thinking (using a picture listener), but this may still result in a bad picture.  We definitely need to remove the picture listener eventually, but when the first new picture is received, it may not have useful data.  On the other hand, we don\u0027t want to save pictures several times.",

      "message": "To elaborate on Leon\u0027s reply, it may be very useful to have logic like this, but the problem is complex. Some pictures are still only partially complete when the picture listener is called; for instance, script may still run and resources like images may not be loaded. It would be very useful to examine the captured picture and see if it is empty in deciding to keep the capture or attempt another. On the other hand, a page may have animations so that it is never really finished drawing, so a hard timer may also be required. I prefer to see some additional iteration rather than accepting this change as-is, or at minimum have pages that demonstrate the current shortcomings as examples so that we can make sure we don\u0027t regress in the future. For the latter, I\u0027d like to see a reference to a bug that contains the repro steps showing the effects of this change.",
